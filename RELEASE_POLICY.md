# Release Policy

Applicable from `flask-react@1.0.0` forwards

### Versioning

`flask-react` follows semantic versioning whereby the version number is always in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- Patch bump : Bug fixes
- Minor bump : New features (with backwards compatibility)
- Major bump : API breaking changes

For Major and Minor bumps release candidates should be released around 2 weeks prior to the bump and are indicated by MAJOR.MINOR.0.rc.

For more information see the full semantic versioning specification at https://semver.org/.

### Release Timing

Patch releases should be done after every fix of a major bug (as tagged in the github issue tracker).
Major releases should be kept to the minimum.
